Loading tidyverse package and setting global options
```{r}

Reading and cleaning the dataset 
```{r}
wh_pay = read_csv("./data//white_house_2017_salaries_clean.csv") %>% 
  select(-(starts_with("X")))
```

In 2017, the White House spent a total of $ `r sum(wh_pay$SALARY)` on the salaries of `r nrow(wh_pay)` employees. 

Below is a table showing the top 10 earners 

```{r}
wh_pay %>% 
  top_n(1, SALARY) %>% 
  arrange(desc(SALARY)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

wh_pay %>% 
  filter(SALARY > 100000) %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarize(NUMBER = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Of the 153 staff earning more than $100,000 only 51 of them are female. 

```{r}
wh_pay %>% 
  filter(SALARY < 100000) %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarize(NUMBER = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Of the remaining 224 that earn less than $100,000, 115 of them are female. This include Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kusner, and Reed Cordish all of whom have a salary of 0. Gary Cohn, millionare former CEO of Goldman Sachs has a salary of 30,000. 

```{r}
wh_pay %>%
  group_by(GENDER) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% knitr::kable()

wh_pay %>% 
  group_by(TITLE, GENDER) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
wh_pay %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(SALARY),
            median = median(SALARY)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}

  group_by(GENDER) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(SALARY),
            median = median(SALARY))  %>%
